zsaplink-plugins-for-apis-enabling-test-automation-of-odata-services
====================================================================

This project consists of all the ZSAPLINK plugins required to import the APIs (Function Modules) that can be 
used for ECATT based test automation of OData Services exposed through SAP Netweaver Gateway (Gateway hub on ABAP stack).

Please find all the information in ODATA_TEST_AUTOMATION_API.zip. Refer to the README.txt file inside the 
ZIP file for installation instructions. Once all the APIs are available in the target system, you should be able to call 
these Function Modules in your ECATT test scripts for enabling automation of your oData services. You may 
also refer to the documentation for the Function Modules to understand their usage.

For any clarifications or issues with the usage of these Function Modules, you may contact following people:
